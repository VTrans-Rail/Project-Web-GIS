Web Setup Steps
===============

The processing tasks are all automated, but I want to document the web setup steps.

###Setup Steps:
- Project Review Dashboard 
- Project Review Map 
- Project Creation Form 
- Project Status Update Form 

###Project Review Map
1. Add [service](http://vtransmap01.aot.state.vt.us/arcgis/rest/services/Rail/PROJ_Review/FeatureServer) to the map
2. Rename features 
  a. `PROJ Review - Asset Projects` to `Asset Projects`
  b. `PROJ Review - Track Projects` to `Track Projects`
3. Add [Rail Lines](http://vtransmap01.aot.state.vt.us/arcgis/rest/services/Rail/Rail_Lines/MapServer)
4. Add [Rail Mile Posts](http://vtransmap01.aot.state.vt.us/arcgis/rest/services/Rail/Rail_MilePosts/MapServer)
